## 📊 Database Schema Analysis

### ✅ **Well-Designed Schema**

```
📋 Database Tables:
├── employee (13 records)
├── employee_info (13 records)
├── employee_role (13 records)
├── company_roles (3 records)
├── customer_identifier (19 records)
├── customer_info (19 records)
├── orders (TBD records)
├── common_services (18 records)
└── [other tables...]
```

### 🔍 **Key Observations**

1. **Proper Normalization**

   - Employee data split across `employee` and `employee_info`
   - Customer data split across `customer_identifier` and `customer_info`
   - Role-based access control with `employee_role` and `company_roles`

2. **Efficient Indexing**

   - Primary keys on all tables
   - Foreign key relationships properly indexed
   - Unique constraints on email fields

3. **Data Volume**
   - Small to medium dataset (13-19 records per table)
   - Good for development and testing
   - Performance will scale well with growth
