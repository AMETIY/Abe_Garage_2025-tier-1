# 🎨 Kiro Prompt – Implement UI Feature Based on Screenshot

Hey Kiro 👋

I’m about to share a **screenshot of a feature/design I want you to implement**.

When you begin working on it:

👉 **Please follow the formatting, layout, and visual design as closely as possible.**
👉 **Please Make the Look Modern & Standout Based on The Screenshots**

✅ Pay *very close attention* to:
- Layout and component positioning  
- Font sizes, colors, and spacing  
- Backgrounds, shadows, gradients, and z-index stacking  
- Button placements, hover effects, and transitions  
- Element alignment across devices (responsiveness)

📐 Think in **pixels and placement** — even small visual details matter. Don’t skip the “little things.”  
This is not just about making it functional — I want the **UI to feel exactly like the screenshot.**

🧠 **Ultra Think** and ask yourself:
- How can I make this look nearly identical?
- What is the visual hierarchy here?
- What’s the spacing rhythm?
- Is everything sitting exactly where it should be?

🛠️ Use the existing CSS structure and styles located in:
- `client/src/assets/styles/custom.css`
- `client/src/assets/template_assets/css`
- `App.css`, `index.css` (if relevant)

If any behavior is not clear from the image, ask me for clarification **before guessing**.  
When you’re ready, I’ll drop the screenshot.

Thanks!
