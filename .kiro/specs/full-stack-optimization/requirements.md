# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses a comprehensive full-stack audit, planning, UI enhancement, and performance optimization initiative for the Abe Garage automotive management application. The goal is to systematically analyze the existing React + Vite frontend and Node.js + Express backend, identify areas for improvement, and implement modern, responsive, and performant solutions while maintaining the existing architecture and beginner-friendly codebase approach.

### Requirement 2: Planning and Documentation

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want detailed planning documents so that I can track progress, understand implementation strategies, and ensure all requirements are met systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning documents are created THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive plan.md file with implementation strategy and task breakdown
2. WHEN requirements are documented THEN the system SHALL create requirements.md with all technical and functional requirements
3. WHEN design decisions are made THEN the system SHALL document them in design.md with visual and structural explanations
4. WHEN tasks are defined THEN the system SHALL create tasks.md with clear, trackable to-do items for implementation

### Requirement 3: Employee Management UI Enhancement

**User Story:** As a garage manager, I want an improved employee management interface so that I can efficiently manage staff information with better usability and visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the employees page THEN the system SHALL display improved form validation with clear error messages

3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL provide proper spacing between input fields and the Show Active/Inactive button
4. WHEN viewing employee lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for better performance
5. WHEN accessing from different devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Requirement 4: Customer Management UI Enhancement

**User Story:** As a service advisor, I want an enhanced customer management interface so that I can quickly filter and manage customer information with improved visual indicators.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the customers page THEN the system SHALL display a filter button beside the input field with proper spacing
2. WHEN filtering customers THEN the system SHALL toggle between red (inactive) and green (active) customer status indicators
3. WHEN browsing customer lists THEN the system SHALL implement pagination for better data management
4. WHEN accessing the page THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clean, and fully responsive layout

### Requirement 5: Services Management Enhancement

**User Story:** As a service technician, I want a reliable and modern services management interface so that I can effectively manage service offerings and pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing services endpoints THEN the system SHALL function without connection or data retrieval errors
2. WHEN viewing the services page THEN the system SHALL display a modern, clear, and responsive design
3. WHEN managing services THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive navigation and data manipulation capabilities
4. WHEN testing services functionality THEN the system SHALL validate proper frontend-backend integration

### Requirement 6: Integration and Logic Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validated frontend-backend integration so that I can ensure data flows correctly and APIs function as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing API connections THEN the system SHALL identify and resolve any connection issues or endpoint mismatches
2. WHEN validating data flow THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent logic between frontend and backend implementations
3. WHEN reviewing request handling THEN the system SHALL implement best practices for API communication
4. WHEN form validation is tested THEN the system SHALL provide consistent validation patterns across all forms

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast-loading and responsive application performance so that I can complete tasks efficiently without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizing frontend performance THEN the system SHALL implement asset minification and React/Vite optimization techniques
2. WHEN improving load times THEN the system SHALL optimize chunk sizes and reduce initial page load time
3. WHEN optimizing backend performance THEN the system SHALL improve query efficiency and middleware performance
4. WHEN performance changes are made THEN the system SHALL ensure no existing functionality is broken

### Requirement 8: Code Cleanup and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean, well-organized code so that I can maintain and extend the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning the codebase THEN the system SHALL remove unused variables, functions, and imports
2. WHEN removing debug code THEN the system SHALL eliminate console.log statements and debugging artifacts
3. WHEN formatting code THEN the system SHALL apply consistent styling using ESLint and Prettier standards
4. WHEN reviewing code quality THEN the system SHALL ensure all files are clean, minimal, and beginner-readable
5. WHEN removing dead code THEN the system SHALL eliminate commented-out blocks and unused code sections

### Requirement 9: Deployment Strategy and Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a comprehensive deployment strategy so that I can deploy the application to production environments with proper configuration management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating deployment documentation THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guides for both backend (Render.com) and frontend (Vercel) deployment
2. WHEN configuring database options THEN the system SHALL implement dual-database strategy supporting both MySQL (local) and PostgreSQL/SQLite (production)
3. WHEN managing environment variables THEN the system SHALL specify required variables and secure secret handling practices
4. WHEN preparing for deployment THEN the system SHALL identify files for GitHub tracking, .gitignore exclusions, and production bundling
